    "\n",
    "Beautiful!\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's now create a training loop and a testing loop to train and evaluate our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using the same steps as the previous notebook(s), though since our data is now in batch form, we'll add another loop to loop through our data batches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our data batches are contained within our `DataLoader`s, `train_dataloader` and `test_dataloader` for the training and test data splits respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "A batch is `BATCH_SIZE` samples of `X` (features) and `y` (labels), since we're using `BATCH_SIZE=32`, our batches have 32 samples of images and targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "And since we're computing on batches of data, our loss and evaluation metrics will be calculated **per batch** rather than across the whole dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means we'll have to divide our loss and accuracy values by the number of batches in each dataset's respective dataloader. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's step through it: \n",
    "1. Loop through epochs.\n",
    "2. Loop through training batches, perform training steps, calculate the train loss *per batch*.\n",
    "3. Loop through testing batches, perform testing steps, calculate the test loss *per batch*.\n",

    "5. Time it all (for fun).\n",
